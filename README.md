# Timing-Utilities
Timing utilities library for Processing. Version 0.1b.

This library has a Stopwatch class right now for keeping time using the PApplet class' millis() method.

## Download  

Download the timing_utils.zip file [from here](https://github.com/Lord-of-the-Galaxy/Timing-Utilities/blob/master/timing_utils.zip).

## Installation  
  
Unzip and put the extracted timing_utils folder into the libraries folder of your Processing sketches. Reference and examples are included in the timing_utils folder. 

## Dependencies

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is required to use this library.  
Update will come soon to use built in Java methods to remove all dependency on Processing fro some classes.
